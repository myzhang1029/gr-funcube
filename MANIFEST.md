gr-funcube is an linux and OSX addon for gnuradio to implement a funcube dongle pro+ source.
On linux it autodetects the correct soundcard from /proc/asound/cards.
This idea was taken from the osmosdr drivers.  To control the device  the hidapi usb version is used.

It contains four components:
 
Funcube Dongle              - The complete V1.0 source block
Funcube Dongle control      - The control block, to set frequency, gain, etc.

Funcube dongle Pro+         - The complete V2.0 source block 
Funcube dongle Pro+ control - The control block, to set frequency, gain, etc.

The  control block are used inside the source block but can be used standalone, too.
All blocks contain a message port to set the frequency by messages.

You find these blocks in grc
